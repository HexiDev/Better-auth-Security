# Better-Auth Security Plugin

![Better Auth Security Banner](./assets/banner/blue2.png)

A security-focused plugin for [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) built with TypeScript and Bun runtime, providing enhanced authentication security features.

## About

This plugin extends better-auth with additional security capabilities, focusing on device fingerprinting and fraud prevention. Built with TypeScript for type safety and Bun for optimal performance.

## Features

### üì± Fingerprint Package

Advanced device fingerprinting capabilities for enhanced authentication security. Tracks device characteristics, detects suspicious behavior, and helps prevent account takeover attacks.

**[üìñ View detailed Fingerprint documentation ‚Üí](./docs/fingerprint.md)**

Key capabilities:

- **Device Fingerprinting**: Collects unique device characteristics for identification

**More coming soon!**

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install better-auth-security

# yarn
yarn add better-auth-security

# pnpm
pnpm add better-auth-security

# bun
bun add better-auth-security
```

### Basic Setup

**Server (auth.ts)**

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { fingerprint } from "better-auth-security/fingerprint";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    fingerprint({
      endpoints: ["/sign-in/email", "/sign-up/email"],
      suspiciousThresholds: {
        accountsPerFingerprint: 3,
        fingerprintsPerAccount: 5,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

**Client**

```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { fingerprintClient } from "better-auth-security/fingerprint/client";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [fingerprintClient()],
});
```

## Security Features

## Important Security Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **This plugin requires custom fingerprinting modules for production use.**

The built-in modules (screen and WebGL) are basic examples. Effective fingerprinting requires extensive browser data collection that must be implemented based on your specific security requirements.
